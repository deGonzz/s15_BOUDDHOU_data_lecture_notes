# Lecture Notes for Data Engineering in Spring 2015
## Lecture 1

Prof. Anderson is asking us to create a repo on Github and take notes in Markdown. 

### What about Big Data

Social Networks
Data Analytics - Storage
Data Sampling
---
---
Machine Learning
eg statistics is based on sampling. which method to use to get a sample? Big data can change the wau we use stat because we're not sampling. We're using the actual numbers.

### Storage

NoSql: optimizes queries you care about from unstructured schemas. 
Sql: Sql is good for schema that optimize queries that you're always interested in. 
e.g. see http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/
Data moedeling is "wicked" hard
(utf8, which Twitter uses, is better than ASCII to for instance show emojis - ASCII is too limited)

#### Technoogies
Document
Graph
Key-Value stores
Columnar

#### Infoviz (side effects)

### Data Lifecycle
Collection \ 
            Clean Up -> Storage <- -> Processing 
                        Analysis -> Query + Visualize + Act  
                                    ALL THIS LEADS TO QUESTIONS
Generation /

#### Question
Curation (prioritization of data source, which one gives most value?) \
                                                                        
Triage (prioritization of a situation)                                /
